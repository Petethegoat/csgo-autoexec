## [autoexec.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petethegoat/csgo-autoexec/master/autoexec.cfg)
A reasonably slim yet feature packed autoexec.cfg for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](http://counter-strike.net).

#### Installation
Place `autoexec.cfg` in your `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder.

Ingame, open the console and type `exec autoexec`. Now the autoexec should take effect without any further action from you in future.

The included binds are disabled by default, and you will need to uncomment them if you wish to use them. Don't forget to setup the crosshair to your liking if you wish to use the fullscreen crosshair bind!

#### Features
- Radar zooms in with use key.
- Net graph visible when looking at the scoreboard.
- Damage given visible without checking the console.
- Jump-throw bind for consistent jumping grenades.
- Fullscreen crosshair bind to line up grenades.
- Aliases and binds to quickly set up a match to practice.

#### Default Binds
- `Tab` Scoreboard and netgraph.
- `E` Use and radar zoom.
- `V` Fullscreen crosshair.
- `H` Jump-throw.
- `P` Give smoke and switch to it (requires sv_cheats 1).
- `Alt` Noclip (requires sv_cheats 1).

#### Commands
- `practice_basic` Enables cheats, sets roundtime to 60, gives $50000, and enables buying anywhere.
- `practice_grenades` Enables cheats, sets roundtime to 60, gives $50000, enables buying anywhere, kicks all bots, and enables health regeneration.
