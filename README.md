## [autoexec.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Petethegoat/csgo-autoexec/master/autoexec.cfg)
A reasonably slim yet feature packed autoexec.cfg for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](http://counter-strike.net).

**This will get you banned from ESEA, and possibly other services that prohibit jumpthrow binds. Make sure you remove them in their entirety before playing on ESEA servers, including PUGs.**

#### Installation
Place `autoexec.cfg` in your `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder.

Ingame, open the console and type `exec autoexec`. Now the autoexec should take effect without any further action from you in future.

The included binds are disabled by default, and you will need to uncomment them if you wish to use them. Don't forget to setup the crosshair to your liking if you wish to use the fullscreen crosshair bind!

#### Features
- Radar zooms in with use key.
- Decals cleared with use key.
- Net graph visible when looking at the scoreboard.
- Damage given visible without checking the console.
- Jump-throw & run-jump-throw binds for consistent grenades.
- Fullscreen crosshair bind to line up grenades.
- Aliases and binds to quickly set up a match to practice.

#### Default Binds
- `Tab` Scoreboard and netgraph.
- `E` Use, radar zoom, and r_cleardecals.
- `V` Fullscreen crosshair.
- `H` Jump-throw.
- `J` Run-jump-throw.
- `Numpad 0-3` Buys and equips smoke grenades, flashbangs, molotovs, and HE grenades.
- `Alt` Noclip (requires sv_cheats 1).

#### Commands
- `practice` Enables cheats, sets roundtime to 60, kicks bots, sets cash to 50000, enables infinite ammo, and enables grenade trajectories and impact and penetration data.
- `credits`
